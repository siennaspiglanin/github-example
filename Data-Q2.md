# Data
## We will get our information from the following sources
  - List of all the cities in United States with Per Capita Income:<br/>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_counties_by_per_capita_income<br/>
  - List of all the cities in United States with population density and coordinates:<br/>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population<br/>

From Four Square API, we will obtain: <br/>
- List of all venues in each neighborhood of the selected city  <br/>
- List of all venues in each city <br/>

Using this data, we will select the best city based on values such as number of venues, state income per capita, and population density. Once the city is selected, we will then search for the best neighborhoods using the same approach.
